# Summertime Peach
This is Summertime Peach, my personal repository for everything Peach in SSBM. This will include my writeups, analyses and videos about Peach.

## Who is this for?
No one in particular, it is just a handy way for me to work on my progress with Peach in the game. The repository is public so feel free to browse through the files.

## Why is this on GitHub?
Mainly because GitHub is a good way to sync data and work on projects even when you're not on your main workstation. I don't have the pretention to say this repository will be useful to anyone, but if people want to, they at least have access to the information in there.

## You're probably a scrub, who are you to pretend to know the game?
I don't.
